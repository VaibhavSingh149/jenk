I explored the Jenkins dashboard and learned how to create a basic pipeline job using the built-in Pipeline syntax.
I was able to configure stages, simulate actions with sleep commands, and observe each step's output using the Console Output and Stage View.
I've achieved the following tasks in the assignment


### Objectives:
