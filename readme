groovy

I explored the Jenkins dashboard and learned how to create a basic pipeline job using the built-in Pipeline syntax.
I was able to configure stages, simulate actions with sleep commands, and observe each step's output using the Console Output and Stage View.
Making a change to the pipeline and rebuilding gave me insight into how iterative and flexible Jenkins automation can be.
Overall, I gained confidence in navigating Jenkins and understanding its core CI functionality.
